## Black Friday Shopping Application
A Java application that demonstrates the implementation of observer and composite pattern. Allows for the simulation of a Black Friday Deals program that notifies customers when there are deals. Additionally, represents products and categories through a unified ProductComponent class, allowing for dynamic grouping of categories and products for the deals. 

### Design Patterns Implemented
#### 1. Observer Pattern
Observer pattern was used in order to notify the customers when there are Black Friday Deals. Customers can subscribe to the deals and will be notified whenever there is a new deal. If a customer is not subscribed, they will not be notified but a statement will be displayed to demonstrate that they are not subscribed. 

#### 2. Composite Pattern
Composite pattern was used in order to work with products and categories through a common interface. This way, products and categories can be treated the same via the common interface, which is useful when grouping multiple products or categories together into a unified "deals" category. 

### Resources Used
- Observer pattern and composite pattern slides
- Talked with Esperanza Paulino about our UMLs and how we were approaching the classes and their structure. Coded up individually.
- Dr. Roy's Office Hours
